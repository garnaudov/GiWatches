# OnlineStore
The project will be fully complete online store platform for watches. It will include navigation and routing that takes the user to different pages with multiple categories of items so they will be able to add them in their cart (including Sing in (using their Google profile or email/password traditional way)/Sign up/Sign Out feature). From that cart the customers will be able to checkout, increase or decrease the quantity of the items and see the live changes. Furthermore, the application will provide a payment option.
> (It will be without affecting live data or interacting with the banking networks)

Technologies that will be used:
- **React/Redux**.
- Integration with **Firebase**.
- Integration with **Stripe API** for handling payments.

> That is the beggining :) There will be some additional features that will be clarified during the process of developement
